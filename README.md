# Neighborhood Vibes
## _Find a home in your dream neighborhood_

## Project Authors: Jeff Grant, Daniel Kim, Bo Kim, Ewelina Smierzynska

#### 1. Description
Finding a home in a new neighborhood can be difficult and overwhelming. Although there are
several applications that already assist in researching homes, not many provide comprehensive
information about both neighborhoods and homes. Most are either locked behind a paywall
(e.g., neighborhoodscout.com) or contain brief statistics on certain topics such as property
listings (e.g., roofstock.com or Zillow) rather than comprehensive information about
neighborhoods.
The purpose of our application is to provide users with a variety of tools to assist them in
choosing an ideal home in an ideal neighborhood in the following six cities:

- Indianapolis, Indiana
- Nashville, Tennessee
- New Orleans, Louisiana
- Philadelphia, Pennsylvania
- Tampa, Florida
- Tucson, Arizona

A user can search for neighborhoods matching their lifestyles by selecting preferred
characteristics about the neighborhood such as dog friendly, restaurants and bars that close
late, and places with a hipster ambience. After selecting a few neighborhoods, a user can learn
more about each neighborhood and search for suitable homes in the selected neighborhoods.
The application assists a user with a neighborhood search based on the US Census data and
Yelp data and with a home search based on data from Trulia, an online real estate marketplace.

#### 2. Building App Locally
Please install the following in the terminal prior to running the application. 

```sh
npm install 
npm init
npm install --save react react-dom 
npm install react react-dom leaflet
